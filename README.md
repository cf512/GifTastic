### Developer's Notes

This was an interesting assignment that combined every different aspect of the coursework thus far, with emphasis on APIs, JSON, and possibly our most complex jQuery to date. The dynamic generation of the gifs, attaching multiple json responses to the html elements, and the logic around clicking to toggle still & animated were some of the more challenging parts.

### "Call Any Vegetable" Song Lyrics

```
(This is a song about vegetables, they keep ya regular
They're real good for you)

Call any vegetable
Call it by name
Call one today
When you get off the train

Call any vegetable
And the chances are good
Aw, the vegetable will respond to you

(Some people don't go for prunes...I don't know
I've always found that if they...)

Call any vegetable
Pick up your phone
Think of a vegetable
Lonely at home

Call any vegetable
And the chances are good
That a vegetable will respond to you

Rutabaga, rutabaga
Rutabaga, rutabaga
Rutabay-y-y-y...

(A prune isn't really a vegetable...
Cabbage is a vegetable...)

No one will know
If you don't want to let them know
No one will know
'Less it's you that might tell them so

Call and they'll come to you
Covered with dew
Vegetables dream of responding to you

Standing there shiny and proud by your side
Holding your hand while the neighbors decide
Why is a vegetable something to hide?
```
